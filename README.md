What are BitCommoditiz ?
----------------
BitCommoditiz is a new class of Crypto coin for which difficulty also varies according to the price of an underlying real commodity.

Example: At time of difficulty retarget the spot price of crude oil increased 20% from its value at bitcommodiz 'Oilz' birth date.
The new difficulty target for bitcommodiz 'Oilz' will be: standard difficulty retarget X 1.20 

The aim is to provide a full class of virtual commodities, freely tradable, for which volatility reflects the underlying real commodity volatility.

There is currently 10 BitCommodiz with difficulty retarget varying with price of: gold, platinium, palladium, silver, crude oil, wheat, corn, cotton, coffee, cocoa.
